# BEADL Editor
{: .no_toc}
The BEADL Editor is a Node.js-based web-application hosted on AWS and can be accessed via [https://beta.beadl.org](https://beta.beadl.org).

At the moment the application is in a closed beta stage so the access is limited to invited test users only. Once comments, requests, and additional requirements based on the test users' feedback are implemented, we will open the application for public access. 

If you want to be part of the test users, please reach out to michael.wulf (at) wustl.edu for requesting access and further instructions.
