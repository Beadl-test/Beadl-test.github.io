# BEADL Editor
{: .no_toc}
The BEADL Editor is implemented as a Node.js-based web-application hosted on AWS and the current beta version can be accessed via [https://beta.beadl.org](https://beta.beadl.org).

At the moment the application is in a closed beta stage and the access is limited to invited test users only. Once comments, requests, and additional requirements based on the test users' feedback are implemented, we will open the application for public access. 

If you want to be part of the test users, please reach out via email to `michael.wulf(at)wustl.edu` for requesting access and further instructions.
