# BEADL - BEhavioral tAsk Description Language
<!-- {: .no_toc}-->

Technological advances in neuroscience, in part supported by the BRAIN Initiative, have dramatically increased the possibilities for monitoring, quantifying, and  manipulating brain activity during behavior. In contrast, efforts to describe behavior have lagged behind. One reason for this is that there is no general formal framework to design or describe behavioral tasks, which are typically performed using specialized and often ad hoc hardware and software systems. The lack of universal behavioral task descriptions makes it challenging to communicate, share, publish, and reuse behavioral tasks.
