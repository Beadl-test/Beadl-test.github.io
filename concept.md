# Concept of BEADL
BEADL uses a Finite State Machine (FSM) framework to define behavioral tasks. More specifically, it defines a behavioral task as Moore machines, in which transitions between states are triggered if certain events happen and in which output actions only depend on the current state the machine is in. Since general FSM-frameworks are too limited to implement a range of different task descriptions in a compact and practical way (e.g. manageable amount of states), we extended the FSM framework with so-called virtual entities.
