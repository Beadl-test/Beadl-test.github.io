# Concept of BEADL
BEADL uses a Finite State Machine (FSM) framework to define behavioral tasks. More specifically, it defines a behavioral task as Moore machines, which output actions will only depend on the current state the machine is in. Since general FSM-frameworks are too limited to implement a range of different task descriptions in a compact and practical way (e.g. manageable amount of states), we extended the FSM framework with so-called virtual entities.
